# One Open

This is a three-dimensional digital space that you can explore from a first person perspective using a mouse and keyboard. It was built with the minified [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master) library created by [Mr.doob](https://github.com/mrdoob), along with several awesome modules that you can find in that repo. You can see the credits for those modules in their respective files in my project, the copyright license for the marble image I used is in the textures folder, and you can find the crystal normal I used for the floor, as well as other great texture packs, [here](https://3dtextures.me/author/gendosplace/).

## Why not a traditional platformer?

Video game design is usually constricted to gameplay mechanics that support a competitive system, a series of puzzles, or a linear narrative. Independent developers and installation artists in recent years, however, have been progressively creating more commercially viable digital interactive experiences that don’t fall in any of those traditional categories. These works occupy a space outside of points and upgrades, yet still captivate audiences that can number in the hundreds of millions. I think it’s important to try to explore why that growing user community is attracted to these immersive experiences, in the hopes of better understanding what makes people want to interact with digital technologies in general.
